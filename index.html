        <h2>Repository</h2>
        <p>
            This repository hosts the Python codes for the examples and algorithms discussed in <em>Numerical Methods For Chemical         
            Engineers</em>. This book (under preparation) is a graduate level course in the said topic. This content has been developed and taught by <b>Prof. Vemuri Balakotaiah</b>, who is also the main author of this book, at the University of Houston for many decades.
            I have had the good fortune of studying this course from him. The purpose of this book is to enable the reader (practitioner) to 
            solve the differential and algebraic equations that arise in modelling of chemical processes by writing their own code in a language             of their choice. This book is unique in its choice of material to equip the reader with the skillset necessary to understand,                    synthesize and analyze algorithms for solving novel research problems.

        <p> <u>Why Python?</u> 
        </p>
        <p>
            We chose Python because of its  popularity and ease of understanding for a novice. Python                             has several libraries available which are wrappers to the widely used FORTRAN packages. In cases where Python's slower speed of                  execution becomes a hurdle, the just-in-time compilation, available through the Numba library comes in handy. If this also is not                enough for the application then the critical code blocks can be executed in FORTRAN and C++ while the rest can be executed in Python.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I hold a PhD degree in Chemical Engineering from University of Houston. Over the years, I have worked on various projects involving 
            numerical methods applied to chemical processes. My interests include teaching, reaction engineering and computational fluid                     dynamics. I am currently employed in the research divison of ExxonMobil in the Woodlands, TX, USA.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking, movies and swimming.
