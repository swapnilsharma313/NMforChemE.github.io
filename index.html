        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>
            This book is a graduate level course in numerical methods for chemical engineers. Some of the algorithms discussed in this book have
            been made available in Python. This course has been taught by Prof. Vemuri Balakotaiah at University of Houston for many decades.
            I have had the good fortune of studying this course from him. The purpose of this book is to enable the reader (practitioner) to 
            solve PDEs that arise in modelling of chemical processes by writing their own code in a langiage of their choice. This book is unique
            in its choice of material to equip the reader with the skillset necessary to understand, synthesize and analyze algorithms
            for solving research problems. We choose Python as the language of choice because of its popularity and ease of understanding for a novice.
